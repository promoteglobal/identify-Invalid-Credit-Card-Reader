# identify-Invalid-Credit-Card-Reader

###  How to use:
If you would like to identify invalid credit card numbers and who issued them, just clone to to your machine and swap out the array of numbers for your numbers.  You will see the results in the console.

### Challenges and credits
This was a practice project from the full stack program at codeacademy.  I wrote all of the script.js file, there was only one page. The only thing given to me were the array of valid and invalid credit card numbers and general hints on how to build it.  This was done in 5 hours.
